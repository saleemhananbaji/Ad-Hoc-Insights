# Ad-Hoc-Insights

## Project Overview
This project is based on Atliq Hardware, a global computer hardware company. The company’s stakeholders often raise ad-hoc business requests to understand customer behavior, product growth, market performance, and sales trends.
Using SQL, I answered these 10 real-world stakeholder queries by analyzing Atliq’s sales, customer, product, and pricing datasets. The project helped in deriving insights such as top-performing customers, high-growth product segments, sales contribution by channels, and quarter-wise sales trends.

Skills Learned:

- Writing SQL queries to solve real business problems.
- Using Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, and Window Functions.
- Applying Date functions for time-based analysis.
- Performing data validation to cross-check outputs.
- Structuring queries for clarity and reusability.
- Presenting findings in a business-friendly format.
